/*!
*   \brief The CommandReply class stores and processes Command
*          replies.
*   \details The command reply was built around processing
*          redis-plus-plus replies.  The redis-plus-plus
*          generic command execution returns a unique
*          ptr to a hiredis redisReply.  The destructor
*          of the unique ptr will call the hiredis
*          redisReply destructor, which will recursively
*          delete all replies.  As a result, we only
*          construct the CommandReply through move
*          operations because copy operations cannot
*          be performed for a unique_ptr.  This class
*          also makes it easy to process the reply because
*          the CommandReply class masks the type
*          change from RedisReplyUPtr to redisReply
*          as you inspect sub replies.
